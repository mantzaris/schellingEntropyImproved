The article addresses an issue brought to light in previous work showing that the Schelling model of segregation displays a decreasing entropy trace [link to paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/9/623). In order to produce a model consistent with fundamental physical paradigms a model improvement is made where a monetary variable extends the dynamics for urban mobility. The dual dynamic system shows a greater stability in the entropy trace supporting the idea that all complex systems adhere to the principles of physics.
