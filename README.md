The article addresses an issue brought to light in previous work showing that the Schelling model of segregation displays a decreasing entropy trace [link to paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/9/623). In order to produce a model consistent with fundamental physical paradigms a model improvement is made where a monetary variable extends the dynamics for urban mobility. The dual dynamic system shows a greater stability in the entropy trace supporting the idea that all complex systems adhere to the principles of physics. 

A key concept is that as the movement patterns during the simulation iterations act to reduce the entropy, the monetary store of the agents is expended to their local enviornment to hypothetical costs increasing the entropy as a byproduct.
